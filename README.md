# Histolines.com - Open Source Database of Historical Events

[Histolines.com](http://histolines.com/) is an open-source platform where anyone can contribute to a growing database of historical events. Our goal is to create a comprehensive and collaborative resource that supports historical research and education.

We encourage contributors to add events, and in return, we provide an aggregated dataset of all submissions, available here. This data can be used freely to expand the scope of historical research or for personal projects.

How You Can Contribute:

Add individual events directly via our website.

Bulk addition: If you have a large dataset, email us, and we’ll help integrate it into our database.

For more information about our data structure and guidelines for contributing, please visit our [website](http://histolines.com/about/data.php).

Let’s make history accessible for everyone—join us in expanding this open resource!
